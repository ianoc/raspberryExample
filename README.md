raspberryExample
================


This is an example for working with scala on the raspberry pi using the wiringpi C library's interface.


Pin mapping for wiringPi: http://wiringpi.com/pins/


The oracle JDK 8.0 https://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/ is required when working from OS X
This lets an assembly jar be generated on os X and just copied to the pi for execution
